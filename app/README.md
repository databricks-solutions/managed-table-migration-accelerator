# managed-table-migration

A Databricks App powered by [AppKit](https://developers.databricks.com/docs/appkit/v0/), featuring React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

**Enabled plugins:**
- **Analytics** -- SQL query execution against Databricks SQL Warehouses
- **Genie** -- AI/BI Genie conversational interface for natural language data queries
- **Server** -- Express HTTP server with static file serving and Vite dev mode

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v22+ and npm
- Databricks CLI (for deployment)
- Access to a Databricks workspace

## Databricks Authentication

### Local Development

For local development, configure your environment variables by creating a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set the environment variables you need:

```env
DATABRICKS_HOST=https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com
DATABRICKS_APP_PORT=8000
# ... other environment variables, depending on the plugins you use
```

### CLI Authentication

The Databricks CLI requires authentication to deploy and manage apps. Configure authentication using one of these methods:

#### OAuth U2M

Interactive browser-based authentication with short-lived tokens:

```bash
databricks auth login --host https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com
```

This will open your browser to complete authentication. The CLI saves credentials to `~/.databrickscfg`.

#### Configuration Profiles

Use multiple profiles for different workspaces:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
host = https://dev-workspace.cloud.databricks.com

[production]
host = https://prod-workspace.cloud.databricks.com
client_id = prod-client-id
client_secret = prod-client-secret
```

Deploy using a specific profile:

```bash
databricks bundle deploy -t prod --profile production
```

**Note:** Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are legacy authentication. OAuth is strongly recommended for better security.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Run the app in development mode with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at the URL shown in the console output.

### Build

Build both client and server for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates:

- `dist/server.js` - Compiled server bundle
- `client/dist/` - Bundled client assets

### Production

Run the production build:

```bash
npm start
```

## Code Quality

There are a few commands to help you with code quality:

```bash
# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix

# Formatting
npm run format
npm run format:fix
```

## Deployment with Databricks Asset Bundles

The app is part of the repository's one bundle: the root `databricks.yml` includes
`app/resources/app.yml`, and no bundle file lives in `app/`. Deploy from the repository root, which
deploys the jobs, the dashboard and the app together; the Apps platform builds the app at deploy
time. The workspace comes from `--profile`.

```bash
export BUNDLE_VAR_warehouse_id=<warehouse-id>
databricks bundle deploy -t dev --profile <profile>
# Production:
databricks bundle deploy -t prod --profile <prod-profile>
```

Do not run `databricks apps deploy`: the bundle owns the app's lifecycle. Then run the installer;
see [Installation](../docs/00-installation.md).

To restart the app, run `databricks bundle deploy` again. `databricks apps stop/start` drops the
bundle's `config.env`, and the app then fails at boot.
